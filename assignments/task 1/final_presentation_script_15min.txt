## 🎤 Final Presentation Script – Module 9 Task 1
**Title:** Analysis of Flipkart Laptop Reviews  
**Presenter:** Joseph Mario Maggi  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Assignment Aim:** Identify a salient data point influencing product reviews and explain its impact theoretically and with data.

---

### 🕒 0:00–1:00 – Introduction
- Welcome and assignment overview.
- Dataset: 24,113 rows, 7 fields from Flipkart laptop listings.
- Task: Find what drives a good or bad review — is it the review content, ratings, or product features?

---

### 🕒 1:00–3:00 – Initial Data Understanding
- Dataset is mostly descriptive: product name, overall rating, number of ratings/reviews, and written reviews.
- Observed that:
  - 365 unique products.
  - Many reviews contain generic terms like “Good” (e.g., repeated 753 times).
  - High likelihood of review repetition across different products.

---

### 🕒 3:00–5:00 – Repetition Investigation
- Checked for repeated reviews:
  - Globally across all products.
  - Within the same product.
- Found high levels of repetition.
- Conclusion: **Review text is inconclusive as a reliable factor.**

---

### 🕒 5:00–7:00 – Shift to Ratings Analysis
- Compared:
  - `overall_rating` shown on Flipkart.
  - Actual `avg_user_rating` calculated from user-level ratings.
- Created a **rating discrepancy metric**.
- Found consistent inflation of `overall_rating` over user average.

---

### 🕒 7:00–9:00 – Visualization
- Scatter plot shows ratings often lie above the “truth line” (y = x).
- Histogram of discrepancies shows:
  - Most products have small discrepancies.
  - ~25 products lie beyond ±2σ — potential outliers.

---

### 🕒 9:00–11:00 – DSS Perspective
- Discrepancy suggests algorithmic filtering or inflation by Flipkart.
- In a Decision Support System (DSS), this introduces **bias**.
- If discrepancies are unexplained, they weaken decision reliability and ethical fairness.

---

### 🕒 11:00–13:00 – Brand Analysis as Salient Insight
- Extracted brand from product_name.
- Grouped by brand: average, max, min ratings; total reviews.
- Plotted box plots and bar charts:
  - Apple and GIGABYTE: high and consistent.
  - Ultimus, AXL, Avita: consistently lower.
- Conclusion: **Brand is a strong, observable influencer on overall rating.**

---

### 🕒 13:00–15:00 – Final Summary and Recommendations
- Review content = inconclusive.
- Ratings = adjusted, not raw.
- Discrepancy metric reveals systematic inflation.
- **Salient data point:** *Brand has measurable impact on overall rating and perceived product quality.*
- Recommendation:
  - DSS models should incorporate **brand consistency** and **review volume** as decision factors.
  - Platforms like Flipkart should disclose rating logic to support transparency.
- Thank you and invite questions.
